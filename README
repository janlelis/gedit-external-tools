This is a collection of snippets for gedit's external tools plugin.

To use them, just check if the "External Tools" plugin is activated and copy & paste the tools you want into the _Tools -> Manage External Tools..._ menu. Alternatively, you can "download all" files, copy them to ~/.gnome2/gedit/tools and they are automatically recognised by the plugin. Make sure to adjust the shortcuts if you choose the second approach.

Feel free to add useful and handy tool snippets ;)
