h3. This is a collection of snippets for gedit's external tools plugin

To use them, just check if the *External Tools* plugin is activated and copy&paste the tools you want into the _Tools -> Manage External Tools..._ menu.

Alternatively, you can "download":http://github.com/janlelis/gedit-external-tools/tarball/master or clone all files and copy them to @~/.gnome2/gedit/tools@. They are automatically recognised by the plugin. Make sure to adjust the shortcuts.

Feel free to add useful and handy tool snippets ;)
